		<h1>Strategies for improving load times of Websites</h1>
		<h2>by Patrick Gronstal</h2>
		<article class="website-quickness">
			<div class="article-introduction">
				<p>The internet is a magnificently strange, yet wonderful phenomena.
					It is easily one of the most significant and important concepts in not only human history,
					but of all existing things, within the entire universe, ever.  </p>
				<p>The hysterically transcendent, albeit difficult to grasp internet,
					is something akin to discovering god.  Our relationship with the internet is early;
					yet our conceptualization of what we are doing is rooted further into “reality”.</p>
				<p>A major reality of humanity’s relationship with the web is that we need it to be familiar.
					So far many websites are used as portals for individuals to access ideas and commit acts of commerce.
					We as humans see the power and potential of our symbiotic relationship with the internet.</p>
				<p>Web Pages are the cornerstones of the internet.  They root us to reality, while serving what we
					demand from digital content.  The responsivity of websites is ever more important in our growing internet.
						Given the plethora of devices and accessibility points each user is presented with, we need to ensure the
						content we are serving is acceptably quick.</p>
				<p>In the following paragraphs, we will explore how to design for 80% of our worldwide user base,
					at speeds less than 3g!<sup>1</sup></p>
			</div>
			<div class="site-size-matters">
				<p>Over the past few years, page weight has doubled.<sup>2</sup>  This has caused major issues by
					 accessibility standards.  50% of all web page download megabyte size is comprised of mostly images.  Around
				 25%-30% of the webpage is made of JavaScript. <sup>2</sup>.  Therefore, we should ensure that when
			 designing, we are taking these items into account.  We should only be sending the user the absolute necessary
		 items for using the site.  If we are not ensuring that we are designing for optimal device and network use, we
	 are wasting both the user and hosts' money.  By ensuring that we focus on our: delivery, weight of site, and test
 for failure, we are sure to make a good foundation for improving our load time <sup>3</sup>.  To do this, we should focus
on our server, and ensuring we have optimized image sizes for our users.</p>
<p>The average load time of a site is 10 seconds for a top 2000 site! <sup>13</sup>.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="conversion-rate">
				<p>However, speed isn't everything.  Conversion and use rate matters.  The content that you deliver
				is extremely important.  All items you are sending, should be relevant and necessary to the context they are
			being served in.  Otherwise, you run the risk of wasting time, which is exactly <strong>what were <em>
				trying</em> to avoid!</strong></p>
				<p>A person's perception influences the way time passes.</p>
				<p>
				Our designs play a big factor in this.
				By focusing on what looks "clickable", "usable", and having a visually definite form of displaying resources,
				we can influence how a user feels the speed of the page.  Interestingly, studies<sup>4</sup> have shown that Amazon,
				had a faster perceived speed, even though it was significantly slower than all sites it was compared to.
				The reason why it <em>seemed</em> faster, is because users felt like they could complete their tasks.
				Therefore, it is of <strong>paramount</strong> importance, that users are given a full array of completely
				workable options to fulfill their needs.</p>
				<p><em>EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT FROM YOUR HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT FILES, SEND A REQUEST
				TO YOUR HOSTING SERVER!!!</em><sup>5</sup></p>
				<p>With that out of the way, let's talk conversions.  Walmart found that for every single second they reduced
				from a user's load time, they gained 2% in conversions!<sup>6</sup>  This is important for hosting websites.
			If a user spends over 10 seconds trying to access a page, there is a good chance they will abandon the site. <sup>7</sup></p>
			Conversion rates improve by 74% when page-load time dropped from eight seconds to two seconds. <sup>8</sup>
			</div>
			<div class="seo">
				<p>Want better SEO?  Make your page responsive, and ensure you are taking into account your loading time.  Google, Bing,
				found that just a 500 millisecond delay caused a 20% reduction in traffic.<sup>9</sup>  Google designed it's algorithm to rank pages
			with site speed as one of the deciding factors.  If your site is "slow" google will penalize you, and even will downrank you for having poor mobile design! <sup>10</sup></p>
			</div>
			<div class="article-conclusion">
				<p>Overall, the topic of stratigies for improving web page load time, is extremely important.  Whether it's for the business, user, or designer, responsive web design just makes sense.
					Improving the speed of your page is a significant factor in responsive design.  By making your code "DRY", as in, lighter, less repetitive, having appropriate hosting for images, only supplying items that
					users need, you can begin to improve your site's load time.  Then you can monitor your improvement on conversions.  There are too many benefits to not make your page designed responsively, and taking
					into account the types of devices, users, and regions you are going to serve.  Serious web design professionals are discovering and unlocking tools to help businesses and users succeed in navigating the
					infinite complexity of the web.  One of the most certain factors, is that it is better to surf at breaking speed, than be concerned with packing every possibility in each hosted site.  It's much more important
					to identify what content is needed for which device.
